//Hint:
//Thanks for the teaching. I didn't learned the DECO1016 and learn DECO1012 this semester. So I just learned the html and css by myself. So, this assignment is difficuit for me.
//I know my use of html and css is not good and feel confused in some part of the js. I hope i can do better in the future study.
